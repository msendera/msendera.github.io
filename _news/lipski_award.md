Happy to share that I was honoured the [Lipski Award](https://nagrodalipskiego.ideas.org.pl/) for outstanding young computer scientists in Poland. I was awarded in the field of applied computer science for my research in probabilistic deep learning. You can see the results [here](https://nagrodalipskiego.ideas.org.pl/)!
