Today I was honoured to officialy recieve the [Lipski Award](https://nagrodalipskiego.ideas.org.pl/) for outstanding young computer scientists in Poland. The ceremony took place during [ML in PL conference 2025](https://conference.mlinpl.org/) in [Copernicus Science Centre](https://www.kopernik.org.pl/en) in Warsaw. I gave a talk on my research interests, and I explained mostly the AI Scientist research program, and why probabilistic deep learning might be the key to new results in AI for Science. <br> 

The photos and talk recording will be available soon. *Stay tuned!* <br>
