I am a PhD candidate at Jagiellonian University, advised by Prof. Jacek Tabor. Previously, I was a Research Intern at Mila - Quebec AI Institute (2023-2024), working under the supervision of Prof. Yoshua Bengio.

My research bridges the gap between Probabilistic Deep Learning and AI Safety, with a focus on bringing rigorous guarantees to Reasoning systems. I am interested in how we can use tools from Bayesian inference, Causal discovery, and GFlowNets to build AI systems that are not just capable, but reliable and aligned.

I am currently based in Kraków, developing new methods for discrete diffusion and neuro-symbolic reasoning.

<!-- Current Focus:

Reasoning: How can we make diffusion models "think" before they generate?

Safety: Can we embed safety constraints directly into the generative process?

Foundations: Discrete diffusion models via differentiable Top-K. -->
