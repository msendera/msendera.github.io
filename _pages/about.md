<!-- I am a PhD candidate at Jagiellonian University, advised by Prof. Jacek Tabor. Previously, I was a Research Intern at Mila - Quebec AI Institute (2023-2024), working under the supervision of Prof. Yoshua Bengio.

My research bridges the gap between Probabilistic Deep Learning and AI Safety, with a focus on bringing rigorous guarantees to Reasoning systems. I am interested in how we can use tools from Bayesian inference, Causal discovery, and GFlowNets to build AI systems that are not just capable, but reliable and aligned.

I am currently based in Kraków, developing new methods for discrete diffusion and neuro-symbolic reasoning.

**Current Focus:**

Reasoning: How can we make diffusion models "think" before they generate?

Safety: Can we embed safety constraints directly into the generative process?

Foundations: Discrete diffusion models via differentiable Top-K.

I am currently open to select collaborations and consulting on generative modeling and safety topics for late 2025/2026.

I am a PhD candidate at Jagiellonian University, advised by **Prof. Jacek Tabor**, and a recent Research Intern at **Mila - Quebec AI Institute** (2023-2024), where I worked under the supervision of **Prof. Yoshua Bengio**.

I have recently submitted my PhD thesis, *"Probabilistic deep learning: from efficient sampling to principled generation,"* and I am currently awaiting my defense.

My research focuses on **Probabilistic Deep Learning**, with a specific emphasis on **Diffusion Models** and advanced sampling methods like **GFlowNets**. My core mission is to leverage these tools to build AI models that possess stronger **Probabilistic Reasoning** capabilities while remaining **Safe** and aligned. I am particularly interested in how structured generation can bridge the gap between rigorous Bayesian inference and modern deep learning. I am also trying to advance the (amortized) variational inference methods to allow better probabilistic inference in complex, large-scale models like LLMs and Diffusion Models.

**Current Research Focus:**

**Reasoning:** Improving reasoning capabilities in generative models via structured sampling.

**Diffusion:** Developing differentiable Top-K methods for discrete data generation and improving continuous diffusion models.

**Safety & Unlearning:** Embedding safety constraints and machine unlearning directly into the generative process.

Prior to my PhD, I was a Summer Research Student at the **University of Cambridge**, working on early cancer detection using deep learning.

<b>Collaboration Status:</b> Following the submission of my thesis, I am based in Kraków and available for select research consulting and collaborations for the 2025 - 2026.
